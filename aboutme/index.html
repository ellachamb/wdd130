    <p>I am a sophomore studying web design and development! I love playing piano, baking, listening to music, and hiking.</p>
    <p>Since I am going into web design and development, this course will be very beneficial for building a foundation in web development. </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church my whole life and my favorite scripture is Ether 12:4! </p>
